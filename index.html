                    The Medicare Part D late enrollment penalty is incurred if you go 63 days or more without prescription drug coverage once your Initial Enrollment Period ends. The penalty is calculated by multiplying 1% of the national base beneficiary premium by the number of uncovered months. This penalty will be added to your monthly Part D premium for as long as you have Part D.
